# CodSoft-Internship
I’m grateful to Codsoft for the opportunity to work as a Web Development Intern.
Through this internship, I successfully completed three projects — a Portfolio Website, a Basic Calculator, and a Landing Page — which helped me strengthen my front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This experience has boosted my confidence in building user-friendly and responsive websites from scratch. Looking forward to applying these skills in more real-world projects!
